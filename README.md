# SOURCE: GODOTIFIED
Convert Source assets to Godot Engine with ease!

## Why?
Because straight-up ripping the assets is probably illegal and Valve doesn't like this.
This project was made for users to convert the assets themselves in mind.

## Progress so far
**MaterialProcess** (Converting materials) - ~50% of the materials get imported, but can't make it work
**ModelConverter** (Converting models) - not planned, but feel free to contribute.
**MapsUniverse** (Porting maps) - i wish i could make it...

## How to use...
### ...MaterialProcess:
1. Choose the already extracted Source Materials folder **(IT SHOULD CONTAIN .VMT FILES!)**
2. Choose the Godot Engine's game materials folder
3. Wait for it to finish (should take *seconds* literally it's that fast)
